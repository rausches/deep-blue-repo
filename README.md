## *Every Move Counts. Deep Blue Delivers*

Inspired by the legendary supercomputer, Deep Blue, our team embodies the spirit of relentless learning and continuous improvement. Just as Deep Blue revolutionized its field by adapting, analyzing, and pushing boundaries, we strive to tackle challenges with the same innovative mindset. We aim to learn from every experience, evolve through collaboration, and persevere until we achieve our goals. *Every move counts.*

This project will serve as our senior capstone and demonstrate our capabilities in programming, web app development, and design.
