## Every Move Counts. Deep Blue Delivers
### About Us

Inspired by the legendary supercomputer, Deep Blue, our team embodies the spirit of relentless learning and continuous improvement. Just as Deep Blue revolutionized its field by adapting, analyzing, and pushing boundaries, we strive to tackle challenges with the same innovative mindset. We aim to learn from every experience, evolve through collaboration, and persevere until we achieve our goals. *Every move counts.*

This project will serve as our senior capstone and demonstrate our capabilities in programming, web app development, and design. 

### Vision Statement 

Our vision is to create an inclusive digital culture where everyone—whether a developer, business owner, or designer—can contribute to making websites accessible, inclusive, and equitable. With 'UX Checkmate,' we make it easy for anyone to improve their websites by simply inserting a web link. Our tool helps identify areas for accessibility enhancement, offering actionable suggestions and visual mockups to guide improvements. As technology continues to advance, we aim to bridge the gap for those without technical experience, ensuring that every user, regardless of their abilities, can navigate and engage with the web seamlessly. By fostering collaboration and inclusion, we strive to make the digital world accessible to all, building a future where no one is left behind.
